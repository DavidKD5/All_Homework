### BlockFI

**Overview**

BlockFI is a digital assets fintech company that connects traditional financial services to cryptocurrency markets. Founded by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez in 2017, BlockFi has created an opportunity for both institutional and retail clients with access to crypto-assets, lending, payments, and asset management. The company sets itself apart from other crypto lenders by providing credit services with competitive rates and institutional benefits to markets with limited access to financial products.

**Business Activities**

BlockFi expands beyond the traditional financial process required to obtain a loan. Usually, a home or vehicle buyer must go through the process of applying for a loan through a traditional bank and is approved based on credit score and other economic factors. At BlockFi, they are tossing the credit report requirement and making their lending decisions based on an individual’s crypto portfolio.
BlockFi promotes its services to cryptocurrency investors of all social classes. One of the main financial advantages of having an account with BlockFi is their interest account that provides clients with the ability to earn interest on their crypto for their long-term investments. Another great service offered is their cryptocurrency-backed loans. Borrowing against crypto assets allows you to receive liquidity without having to sell your cryptocurrency and trigger a capital gains tax. The interest is deductible against capital gains tax in the future.

**Landscape**

BlockFi is an innovator in the financial industry that combines traditional banking services with digital assets. It’s one of the first of its kind to offer crypto lending services that are regulated and located within the United States. U.S. customers have the ability to exchange their fiat currency for stable coins that have a dollar-to-dollar ratio and earn up to 9% just for holding that digital asset in their high-interest accounts. This new and innovative way to acquire interest sets BlockFi as a trendsetter in the crypto and banking industry.
Competition in this industry is still fairly new and unsaturated, however, there are a couple of companies that exist that are doing similar things as BlockFi, each with its own pros and cons. For the sake of this report, only U.S.-based companies or companies that have offices in the United States will be considered competitors of BlockFi.
Celsius Network is UK based company with offices in New Jersey, US. At Celsius, customers can borrow against their long-term investments and earn interest in their accounts similar to BlockFi. An advantage of Celsius over BlockFi is their super-low interest rates for borrowers which can be as low as 1%. Another advantage is their high-interest yield on stable coins which range from 10% to 14% compared to BlockFi 5% to 9%. However, Celsius rates do tend to fluctuate a lot more than BlockFi and they also do not have a web app.
Nexo is another competitive company and it has regulations in several different states in the U.S. Nexo offers high APY rates on stablecoins but only if 10% of the account value is in Nexo Tokens. An advantage at Nexo is their wider range of available crypto assets to be used as collateral towards loans than compared to BlockFi’s selection.

**Results**

BlockFi has made an impact by racing to leverage the value of digital assets over traditional fiat currency. Increased financial access and education for people of all social-economic classes have been the center point of BlockFi’s growth. Over 300,000 account holders have been using BlockFi financial services since its inception. Just in the past year alone, assets under management have grown from $1 billion to $20 billion. Revenues have increased from $1 million to over $45 million and its workforce has grown to over 500 employees.
What does this mean for its customers? It means more institutional funding increasing BlockFi’s ability to lend over 10 billion dollars to its retail and corporate customers. An impressive 0% loss rate has been recorded since it open its financial lending services to customers and the client base grew 10 times in 2020 and over doubled in 2021. BlockFi’s exponential growth proves there is a clear need for its services.

**Recommendations**

BlockFi has the potential to cut the middleman out of the picture for people to be able to purchase digital assets. Currently, the traditional way that most people purchase cryptocurrency is through wire transfer or card transaction on an exchange. BlockFi could provide a direct line towards acquiring digital assets by offering direct deposits into their accounts. How nice would it be for a person who wants to accumulate cryptocurrency that has a second job as an Uber driver to be able to deposit that check into their BlockFi account to purchase cryptocurrency and accumulate interest?
Another suggestion would be to increase the availability of digital assets to be used as collateral for a loan. BlockFi currently allows for loans to be issued out against Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether, and PAXG assets. There are plenty of other large-cap cryptocurrencies that individuals hold which would be nice to have liquidity without having to sell.
Lastly, there is potential for the development of a debit card. Not a debit card that could spend crypto assets but a debit card that could spend fiat currency. A debit card that would spend crypto wouldn’t be economic since the tax regulation states that anytime cryptocurrency is spent it is considered a taxable event. However, if direct deposit was possible, and people wanted to move away from a bank, they could store their fiat currency in a BlockFi account and have a way to spend it if they wish. Also, what if an individual decides to cash out some of their interest accumulated or even just their crypto assets? Why have to move that over to the bank when you can be able to have liquid dollars in just a couple of clicks?
